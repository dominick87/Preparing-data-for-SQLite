# Preparing-data-for-SQLite

In this guided project, I'll clean a CSV dataset and add it to a SQLite database. 

I'll work with data on Academy Award nominations, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission215Solutions.ipynb). The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry.
